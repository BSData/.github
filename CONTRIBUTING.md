# Contributing to BSData

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to BSData and its repos, which are hosted in the [BSData Organization](https://github.com/BSData) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Where to start

> 📝 Please don't file an issue to ask a question. You'll get faster results by using the resources below.

We have an official Discord server where the community chimes in with helpful advice if you have questions.

* [![Chat on Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/558412685981777922?style=popout-square)](https://www.bsdata.net/discord)
* [BSData Homepage](https://www.bsdata.net/)
* [BSData Catalogue Development wiki](https://github.com/BSData/catalogue-development/wiki)

Due to the file format we work with (XML), Pull Requests are not very readable/reviewable:
- In less 📉 active repositories, maintainers may want to just delegate write permissions to you and allow you to commit with full trust.
- In more 📈 active repositories, the most useful kind of contribution by outside collaborators is raising issues.
  Maintainers may delegate tasks to collaborators after discussions; they won't accept Pull Requests without prior communication however.
